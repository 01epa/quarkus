include::./attributes.adoc[]


The `quarkus-amazon-lambda-http` extension allows you to write microservices with Resteasy (JAX-RS),
Undertow (servlet), or Vert.x Web and make these microservices deployable to Amazon AWS using
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html[Amazon's SAM] framework.
